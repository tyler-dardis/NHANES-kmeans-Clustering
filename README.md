# NHANES k-means Clustering Analysis

To view the entire project, open the full notebook [here](https://github.com/tyler-dardis/NHANES-kmeans-Clustering/blob/main/NHANES_k_means_Clustering.ipynb).

**Objective:** Identify clusters of survey respondents in the NHANES dataset.

**Data:** NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Questionnaire Data

**Model Type:** k-means clustering (unsupervised machine learning)

**Tools/Libraries:** Pandas, scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Result

As an example, below is a visualization of the clusters defined by my model, using *age*, *education level*, and *household income* as features.
